Jonathan began his professional career in the military, working in help desk and network specialist roles. A few promotions later, he was assigned to work as a communications advisor to a foreign military. He excelled in this role by using his interpersonal skills to break through language barriers and enable his military counterparts to become self-sufficient. While working with Jonathan, the military unit enhanced their training from basic classroom instruction to running their own battle room simulations in a command center simulated environment. This was an immense accomplishment in Jonathan’s career, and he was awarded a meritorious promotion for his work. During his time in the Marine Corps Reserve, Jonathan also worked in law enforcement as a police officer. He was commended in his personnel record on multiple occasions for his quick decision-making skills and calm demeanor under extremely tense and volatile situations. For six years, Jonathan balanced his military and law enforcement careers while at the same time learning the necessary skills to transition to his current role as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

Jonathan also wishes to use his experience to assist those who want to break into the information security industry. He has participated as a mentor in CyberPatriot, which is a program dedicated to teaching and empowering our nation’s youth with the skills needed to pursue careers in STEM.

Modern-day cyber attacks are capable of causing physical harm and putting lives at risk. Jonathan uses his technical skills and crisis management expertise to help secure our nation's digital infrastructure.
